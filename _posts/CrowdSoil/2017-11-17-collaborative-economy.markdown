There were 4 guests : Marlyne Sahakian, a sociologist, Christophe Dunand, teacher and director of REALISE, Lionel Lourdin an entrepreneur and Nicholas Niggli working at the DG DERI at the State of Geneva. All of them presented different aspects of the collaborative economy, here’s a quick summary of their contributions:

Christophe Dunand explained the general sense of collaborative economy and how it can regroup the worst and the best initiatives. Indeed, this concept needs to be clarified in what it includes or not to clearly differentiate Airbnb and Couchsurfing or Uber and the Taxi service for example. He reminded us the seven criteria of the Chamber of the collaborative economy of Geneva to qualify as a company:

(1) Social wellbeing<br>
(2) Participative Citizenship and Democracy<br>
(3) Ecology<br>
(4) Autonomy<br>
(5) Solidarity<br>
(6) Diversity<br>
(7) Coherence<br>

Marlyne Sahakian explained different theories on a social economy and on an ecological economy and how no links have ever been made between them. And this is what the collaborative economy is trying to do. She presented four different examples of collaborative companies in Switzerland, two concerning mobility and two concerning the exchange box between neighbours. It was interesting to see concrete examples on different topics and different levels of “solidarity” or “ecology” in the collaborative economy.

Lionel Lourdin gave a presentation on new open-source technologies and their importance in the collaborative economy. He underlined that the new technologies are not goals but tools to realize and help implement different initiatives of collaborative economy.

Nicholas Niggli finally said that the state of the planet is clearly worrisome and that we need to take action right now: collaborative economy seems to be a good framework for the future companies. He said that Geneva’s State was actually working on promoting those kind of initiatives and even giving them some support (financial or creating links between different people and different projects). He finished on the importance of linking the local and more international actors in Geneva on that topic.

This conference was meaningful for our project as it is clearly an initiative of collaborative economy. We’re thinking about a meeting with the Chamber of the social and solidary economy in Geneva to discuss more about this topic and its link with our project.
