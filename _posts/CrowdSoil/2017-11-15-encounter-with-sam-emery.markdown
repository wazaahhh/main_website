Samuel Emery holds an agronomy degree from l’HEPIA and is now an organic farmer in a 32-hectare farm in the Lausanne region.
He was one of the first persons we met in order to truly understand the tests we would have to implement in the app and the solutions we could think of regarding the soil remediation.
The following post is a summary of our conversation with him.

1) Soils nowadays

To test the chemical composition of soil is very complicated because the chemical tests are molecule-specific and unless you know precisely what you are looking for, it is unlikely to find relevant and complete information about the chemical composition of the soil and its contaminants.
This is further complicated by the fact that most of the artificially-introduced chemicals tend to get modified by oxidation of partial processing from bacteria. Chemical testing thus rarely finds the molecule introduced and is often unable to detect any by-products that remain after alteration.

2) What should you look for when evaluating the soil?

The first thing to know is the historic of the soil ie what was there before and what is there now.
Also, one needs to take a close look at what grows on the soil. The presence of plants is often a good sign but some plants, when present in a large amount, are indicators of a particular soil’s acidity, humidity or toxicity. One good indicator is to bring some of the soil home and try to plant some specific kinds of seed on it to see if they grow in a controlled environment.
Another thing to look at is the soil itself, its color, odor and texture.
Once those first few assessments are done, a few other tests can be done with more material.

The main tests we talked about with Samuel are to test the soil composition and compaction (spade test), the amount of biologic activity (barber test), the infiltrometry (beer can test), the proportion of clay, sand and silt (glass jar test).

Additionally, some other tests can be performed like an acidity (pH) test and a Nitrate test. Those require some more chemical testing.
More extensive tests can include inorganic chemical testing and require more heavy equipment to do a full background check of the chemical composition of a tested soil.

3) Remediation.

In most cases the best thing you can do to remediate a soil is to give it time and plants. Plants contribute to the well-being of a soil and they usually do a good job at improving soils in bad shape.
Together with Samuel, We have however identified five big options to improve aa soil, depending on the circumstances: Mechanical work, adding an element, arrangement work, planting seeds and letting the soil rest. Often, a combination of those five techniques is recommended.
