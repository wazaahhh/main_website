We are a group of six enthusiastic students who are determined to break the silence on menstruation. That’s an ambitious goal, isn’t it? Well, to understand our motives and project better, let’s start right at the beginning: Our master program and current workshop “Measuring and Predicting Sustainable Development”.

We are all students of the Master in Innovation, Human Development and Sustainability, which is part of the Geneva Tsinghua Initiative for the sustainable development goals. It is an interdisciplinary program that focuses on defining and developing solutions for the SDGs through group projects and hands on activities.

The combination of our different academic backgrounds and experiences makes our group discussions particularly interesting and engaging! We are provided with many opportunities to get out of our comfort zones and think outside the box - and this is exactly what we’re doing in our project about menstrual hygiene management ( MHM) for the workshop “Measuring and Predicting Sustainable Development”. The goal of this workshop is for each group to work on a project of their interest, dig deeper by researching, discussing and meeting up with experts and finally come up with an innovative but feasible solution by the end of December. And now you might wonder how we became the MHM Musketeers...right?

So, it all started with a pitch…

We all got the chance to ‘pitch’ a topic of our interest in the beginning of the workshop. This enabled us to form groups with similar goals and ideas... and guess what? Two out of the six of us presented a topic on menstrual hygiene. Do you think this is surprising? We don’t! Because firstly, menstruation affects roughly 50% of the world population - we are sure you agree that this is proud number! Despite this, it is a social taboo all over the globe (yes, not only in rural Africa but also here in Europe) and sometimes seen as embarrassing, disgusting, impure or even a source of evil. Secondly, we realized how many problems are associated with menstruation - whether they stem  from a lack of access to products, facilities or education. This made us all the more determined to ‘break the menstruation taboo’ and shed light on a topic that is often left in the dark...

That’s it from our side at the moment! However, we’d like to give you an official definition of MHM to take along, so you know what we’re talking about in the posts to come. Right, there you go: “Women and adolescent girls using a clean menstrual management material to absorb or collect blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of the menstruation period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and having access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials” (The Joint Monitoring Program, by WHO and UNICEF, 2012)

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
