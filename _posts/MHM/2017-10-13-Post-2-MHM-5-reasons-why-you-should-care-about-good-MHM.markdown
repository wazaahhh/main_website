Welcome friends to the one and only blog of the MHM Musketeers!

It all started with… the idea of managing menstruation in humanitarian contexts. As you can imagine, this is a challenging topic, as women are on the move and have little personal belongings with them. Managing to have sanitary products at the right time of the month reveals itself to be close to impossible in these settings.

Our group formed, we discussed the topic, and quickly realised that sanitary product distribution was the “only” and “best” feasible solution. Moreover, the issue is covered by a number of NGOs already. So… we shifted our focus!

We first thought of creating a menstrual health toolkit that could be distributed through existing health care centres. This toolkit would include products (reusable? DIY products?), as well as a form of educational content.

But how do you create a single toolkit to serve needs that widely differ, depending on cultural and environmental contexts? Different communities have very different access to facilities such as clean water, or water at all. So suggesting the use of reusable sanitary pads may not be a solution, if you’re addressing a population that already struggles to get drinking water. We felt stuck: even though many initiatives exist, they are not implemented on a wide scale… On the other hand, we didn’t feel like, with our low expertise, we could suggest a better-stronger-cheaper product.

While we continued our quest, it became evident that there was a major problem in MHM: a lack of data and evidence on the scale of the problem. The research papers we came across all have the same conclusion: the problem is a big one, but we need data.

Anyway. You might be wondering why this MHM thing is such a big deal. Also, like us, you probably have no idea of how much it negatively affects the daily lives of hundreds of millions of women. (Yes, there’s more to it than cramps!)

There are five main dimensions around which we studied menstrual hygiene issues:

Education: Many schools do not support adolescent girls or female teachers in managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. For this reason, girls have been reported to miss schools during their menstrual period or even drop out completely.This is strongly linked to the empowerment dimension.

Empowerment : Issues with human dignity, justice and freedom of mobility and social taboos surrounding menstruation exclude women and girls from many aspects of social andcultural life as well as menstrual hygiene services.

Health: Risks of Irritation and Infection, Issues with HygieneSince many women and girls cannot afford or access standard MHM products, they resort to using homemade products often without proper sanitation, this is posing serious health risks

Environment: Waste Disposal and Water and SanitationThe lack of inadequate unsafe disposal for soiled materials with many women being forced to dispose it in secrecy will reinforce the stigma and shame surrounding menstruation.

Economic : Accessibility and Affordability of Products, loss of income & productivity. This impacts vulnerable groups such as low income families, single-income families, racial and ethnic groups.

Outcome of research: there is a lack of data. Confirmed.

Meetings with teachers : Overall highlights Pauline Plagnat-Cantoreggi - reminded us to be careful not to stigmatize women even more. Jaya Krishnakumar- suggested that we could include more quantitative measures in our second phase our project.

Until next time, we’re happy to keep you updated!

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
