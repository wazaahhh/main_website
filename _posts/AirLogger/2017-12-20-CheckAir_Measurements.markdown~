In this post, we describe how measurements obtained from our two LaserEgg 2 gave us the confirmation the PM2.5 air pollution varies between close locations and versus time.
An example is the first simultaneous measurements we did with our Kaiterra Laseregg 2 devices.

There, you can see that measurements taken along different itineraries, on the same trip from Rive to Campus Biotech, give two different PM2.5 exposure values.
Explaining our work, we recorded data from 2 sensors measuring AQI and P.M 2.5 along two urban routes at the same time, from Rive to Campus Biotech, forking at the end of Pont du Mont Blanc, one going by the lake, the other going through the train station and Rue de Lausanne. The aim was to test and visualize how PM2.5 concentration could vary between these two paths.          

In the morning high-density traffic hour (8 AM to 9 AM on November 13th, we separated in two groups to take the measurements. As the mapping shown below (Figure 3), at the same hour, there is a noticeable difference between the air quality in two route. The average of PM 2.5 concentration recorded in the route by the lake is 23.5ug/m3, while the other is 30.6ug/m3, and there is some points in which the PM 2.5 concentration went up to 73ug/m3 (Graph 2-5). As a reference, the WHO recommends a maximal PM 2.5 concentration of 25ug/m3 as a 24 hour mean (WHO, 2005).      

These measurements confirm our use-case and affirm the need for personal air quality measurement.
