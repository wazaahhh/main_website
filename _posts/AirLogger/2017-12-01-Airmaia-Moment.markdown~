We designed three small tests aiming at achieving our M&V,

1. Use one sensor to measure AQI level in Geneva street near fixed sensor station at certain time of day and compare with PM10 indicator (24 hour mean) of the fixed station that day.

2. Use one sensor to measure AQI in bus, tram, private car, traffic point, roadside, urban background, rural village of a typical journey in a short time.

On the evening of 15th November between 17.00 – 18.00 pm, we measured the AQI at the tram station next to Gare Cornavin and by a roadside of Meyrin area (on Geneva air quality measurement stations please see last blog)

One of the group member took the bus to arrive at Gare Cornavin, in the bus the AQI sensor is around 40 – 80, 40 - 50 was read moderate, 50 – 80 was read unhealthy. As soon as she got off the bus in front of the station, the AQI rocketed to 160, it is noticeable that individual smokers in front of the station brings much higher level of AQI. At the tram station of line 18/14 at the side of CFF, the data range observed was about 155 - 225, noticeable peaks are observed when cigarette smoke exhaled from fellow passengers, away from smoke the AQI range could stabilise around 160.

In the tram, the AQI average was about 75 with small fluctuation from Gare Cornavin to Meyrin area (where a suburban air quality measurement station is located), it could be observed that when there are stops with doors open the figure goes slightly higher, it goes up and maintained higher during travel period when a passenger with noticeable smoke scent boarded the tram. Getting off at the Meyrin area with not many traffic, the reading was around 90, she then walked along the road and tested the crossroad at different locations, with little traffic passing the fluctuation range was small. It could be deducted that in urban area away from the central train station, general AQI of urban background would be similar to around 90.

Later she travelled into the countryside with little traffic on the road in the French neighbourhood in a modest private car, the reading of AQI level was steadily around 70 with window open, in the car space, and near the car’s air conditioning air outlet. It seems (not only from this journey), among bus, tram, walking and private car, bus has the biggest difference inside and outside so is the least exposed to pollutants, then tram, little difference there is for private car without air filter installation from the reading on the open road – similar would be for cycling. However, it cannot be concluded that bus is the healthiest option, you might need to wait for a bus for 10 minutes in a station that is a “heavily polluted” by vehicle emissions and smokes of waiting passengers. In another trip, the air quality of a bus journey that involves waiting and boarding was briefly recorded

Overall, on 15th Nov, the level of AQI of urban Geneva was quite unhealthy, in comparison, the health index of air quality of that day was Blue – hardly any health effect. It really takes a personal pollutant sensor to be able to map out the scenarios of a typical journey and find out about the best practice. And cyclists in urban roads, wear a pollution mask whenever, no need to wait for official warning.

Test 3： Record data from 2 sensors measuring AQI and P.M 2.5 in two urban routes at the same hour, map out the difference, compare with nearest public AQI data of the same hour.

In the morning of 13th Nov around 8.00 – 9.00 am, we separated in two groups that travelled from the end of Pond de Mont Blanc to Campus Biotech on two different routes, one into the city along the train station for a while, another one along the major road by the lake… this deserves another post.

Guess what is the highest and lowest AQI and PM 2.5 among all the locations within this hour?
