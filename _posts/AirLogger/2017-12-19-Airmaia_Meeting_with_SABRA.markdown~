To know more about air quality measurement and seek for possible support, we met with Dr. Benoit Lazzarotto, Director of the Geneva Atmospheric Pollution Observation Network. During the meeting, we introduced our projects and some findings, as well as asked him questions about the measurement method and data availability of particular matters in the Geneva Cantonal stations. 

From Dr. Lazzarotto, we learned that the in addition to measuring PM 10, the Necker cantonal air quality station has been equipped with PM 2.5 sensors and record data hourly. These measurements are not directly available to the public, but they will be included on the ge.ch/air website when the OPair 2018 passes. Besides, the official data are subjected to strict statistical process, which means that though most air quality data can be taken continuously, they only record the measurement once or twice per hour and then averaged over a period of one day or even longer. That’s why the official particular matters data provided are much lower than what we measured. And in pursuit of the precision of data, the sensing equipments in the cantonal stations are large and expensive, which prevents the canton to provide data covered all streets and neighbourhoods. 

We introduced our project, which adopt a crow-sourcing, low expenses, and full coverage approach different from the official one to Dr. Lazzarotto, and also showed him some of our findings. He showed interests in our project, and affirmed our approach to crowd-source and publish more air quality data and inform the public about the danger of particular matters pollution. While he had some concerns over the precision of the data provided, since from his experience, the smaller sensor might not provide the accurate data as the contonal stations did. After learning about our plan on building cheaper sensor, he suggested us to calibrate the data from our sensor with the data from catonal station. He also point out that the PM 2.5 level is usually linked with PM 10, so the available PM 10 data can also be the calibration for PM 2.5 measurements. 

Admittedly, the precision of the PM 2.5 data we measured is also our major concern, especially for the device we are building. Therefore, we accepted  Dr. Lazzarotto’s advice to take a measurement in or near the station with our sensors and compare the data with those from the equipments in stations. The experiment will take place soon, and we hope to share more findings with you.
