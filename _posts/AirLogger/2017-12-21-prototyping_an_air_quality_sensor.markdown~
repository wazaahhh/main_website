On the use-case demonstration, we observed a difference of air pollution exposure between the two itineraries, and an important volatility in the data collected. From the hypothesis that the public would benefit from personalized PM2.5 measurements and statistics, and that using the sensors we bought to this extent was cumbersome, we considered the opportunity to build a device assembling PM2.5 measurements, Time, GPS positioning and data-logging abilities.
As a pilot, we wanted to link a portable and automatic air quality sensor, a mobile app to manage and visualize personal device information, and an integrated air quality data service to give users route and health advices to minimise their exposure. Our objective being to enact widespread data collection, we devised a device that would use readily available and inexpensive components, with multiple data integration possibilities.

To measure fine particulate matter presence in the air, we selected between two low-cost sensors, both using optical detection methods, the Shinyei PPD42NS and the Nova SDS-018.
In both sensors, infrared (IR) light is emitted by a LED or a laser in the sensor chamber. With air flow, particles passing through the chamber reflect the light, and their emission is recorded by a phototransistor. Voltage comparators are used to count variations of measured light, and these values are transmitted in the form of a Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) signal, which  is read by the microcontroller, and integrated into formulas to obtain an  approximation to the actual PM2.5 concentration (Figure 4).
The Shinyei PPD42NS is an IR-LED scattering based sensor, available from online resellers for less than $10, its price placing it amongst the cheapest sensors available. It is used in numerous other particle concentration measurement projects, which raised interest from the academia. This allowed its performances to be independently evaluated using professional reference equipment (Austin, 2015), a welcome complement to less than exhaustive documentation. The study shows that, while able to detect relative variations of PM2.5 counts, the method is not precise and sensors benefit from further calibration. In fact, this sensor has several drawbacks if used as-is. Air movement required to cycle air past the detecting chamber is generated by a convection flow, using a small resistor in the measurement chamber, which cannot provide the constant airflow needed for absolute measurements. Power consumption and variations between sensors of the same batch are also of concern.
The Nova Fitness Co., Ltd. SDS-018, is a laser-based scattering sensor. Available online for less than $20, it uses the same measurement process as the Shinyei sensor, with a laser light emission that provides a more uniform and collimated light, which allows a greater accuracy in particle-size differentiation, as well as deeper calibration. Other differences are the integration of a small fan, providing a constant airflow, and a controller allowing serial data transfers and commands. Included and welcome in our application are On-Request sampling and a Sleep mode. Serial output for measurements consists in a sequence of values, including a checksum and decimal values for PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, in ug/m3. A PWM interface similar to the Shinyei output is also available.
These two sensors represent the two main types of civil dust detection sensors. They differ by multiple accounts, the most important for our purpose being the cost, the precision, the current consumption and the time needed to get a valid measurement.

From our measurements and assays, as well as studying online resources, we found the data produced by the Shinyei sensor difficult to aggregate into relevant measurements in our use-case scenario. We determined the Nova SDS-018 sensor more adapted, and easier to build on.
