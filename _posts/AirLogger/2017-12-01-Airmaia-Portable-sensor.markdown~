We bought two identical AQI sensors (called, Laseregg) with PM 2.5 indicator from a Swiss
start-up company that is based in China, Kaiterra. In China, most people get the AQI
information from official readings on apps, the source could be from Chinese official source or
US source released by the US Embassy, these data are not identical but reflect similar trends
with the US data slightly higher than Chinese data. Many customers use small AQI sensor
device with display such as the Laseregg to put at home to test the air pollution at indoor level
and use if for indicating at what level should people turn on their air filter. From Miya’s
experience in Beijing and Chengdu, indoor air pollution AQI is constantly about half of what is
outside before turning on Air filter. In our test in Geneva, we would use it to measure outdoor
air quality at different locations and times.
On Laseregg product information webpage: it is a “high accuracy monitor” that “uses laser-
based light scattering to individually count particles as they enter the device. This allows for
extremely fast measurements, with high accuracy readings calculated every 0.1 seconds”.
During a visit to the cantonal staff who is responsible for measuring Geneva’s air quality, we
learnt that the technical solution of the measurement stations they use also employs light-
based technology.

According to its technical specifications, particles size 0.3 – 10 um are measured, and PM 2.5
concentration range is calculated based upon these measurements.

The staff at Canton of Geneva’s air quality measurement doubted the accuracy of the device,
admittedly, it does not measure PM 2.5 directly, nevertheless, it could serve as a guideline of
range rather than very precise reading.
The canton of Geneva have four fixed stations that measure the city’s air quality:

Stations surroundings:
- Urban: Geneve – Necker near the train station
- Suburban: Meyrin – Vaudagne & Thonex – Foron
- Rural : Avully – Passeiry

Overall AQI data is not available, but it uses color to identify health imapct of current air
quality :
Blue – Pollution Low: Hardly any negative health effects expected
Green – pollution moderate: negative health effects are possible. Especially among people
with existing pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases.
Yellow – pollution evident: negative health effects may occur, especially among people with
existing pulmonary or cardiovascular disease.
Orange – pollution considerable: negative health effects may occur more frequently,
especially among people with existing pulmonary or cardiovascular disease.
Red – pollution high: negative effects may occur more frequently. People with pulmonary or
cardiovascular diseases are strongly affected by the poor air quality.
Purple – pollution very high: Negative effects may occur frequently. People with pulmonary or
cardiovascular diseases are strongly affected by the poor air quality.
In a US based report the AQI and health category is as follows:

Even though the Canton of Geneva measures PM 2.5 in Necker, this data is not made
public, as it is only a pilot to prepare for the possible obligation to measure PM2.5. Data on PM 10 is updated hourly, and it
reflects the mean of last 24 hours, the data and could be checked on either Canton of
Geneva website or the app airCHeck which has 10 000 downloads from Google Play. In the
Swiss national information website on air pollution and fine particles (feinstaub.ch), the
information on fine particles is PM10. In absent of official PM 2.5 data in Switzerland, we will
use the French measure station in Geneva’s neighbouring town Ferney-Voitaire as reference.
