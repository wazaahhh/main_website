There is a strong consensus that air pollution poses significant threat to health. According to the WHO, in 2012, ambient air pollution contributed to 6.7 % of all deaths worldwide. It is commonly known that countries such as China and India, where severe air quality crisis hits international media headlines, have a big pollution problem that carries health consequences. However, probably less known to people is the fact that, in Europe, air pollution is the largest environmental health hazard and that the disease burden resulting from air pollution is substantial (Lim et al., 2012; WHO, 2014 in EEA).

According to EEA report, in Switzerland, a country that is internationally known for its alpine landscape, pristine environment and strict environmental law, 1 in 7th premature death is estimated to be caused by PM 2.5, that is 4980 people in 2016. PM2.5, or fine partuclate matter, can cause or aggravate cardiovascular diseases, asthma and lung cancer. In comparison, the number of death from road accident in Switzerland in 2016 was 216, and 838 – 854 cyclists injured. A study in 2015 shows that traffic accounts for 25% of PM 2.5 and 28% of PM 10 in cities’ air pollution, in Western Europe. Pollution from traffic is deposited onto the road and then re-suspended by vehicle traffic, together with mineral dust particles. So, statistically speaking, for the health of people on the road - especially cyclists and kids on bikes who shares the road with vehicles - wouldn’t an air pollution mask be more efficient in preventing death and injuries than a helmet? Rather, it is a lot more sensible to wear both. Then, why very few people in Geneva do so? (We haven’t spotted anyone that does)

That's why we, a geeky technical solution guy, an air pollution veteran/human sensor, and a business model fanatic initiated this project aiming at finding out answers to the following questions in the scope of a Geneva, i.e. a large urban area in Switzerland:

Is current air quality data accurate, relevant, and accessible?
Is public information and understanding about air quality adequate?
What is the pollution level of locations that are central to people’s daily routine, is there a pattern in there?
How to manage personal exposure to pollution? Can we reduce its health impact?


In order to answer the questions, we defined the project’s Mission and Vision as such:


Mission:
First stage :
- Find out differences between available AQI data and experienced pollution
- Find out public perception of air quality, compare with data measurements
- Explore stakeholders' and public interest in personal pollutant exposure sensor
Second stage :
- Provide a tool for personal air pollutant exposure measurement and action suggestion
- Map air quality, find out patterns and local relevance
- Provide action suggestions and evidence for policy-making

Vision:
- Increase public understanding about air quality issue, provide people with accurate and relevant air quality index
- Help people measure and predict pollution exposure and make better informed transportation choice and activity timing
- Promote the use of environmental-friendly transportation solution and hold policy-makers accountable to address pollution / public health issues


The methods would be one on hand doing perception survey among Geneva residents, and on the other hand measure the micro-local level of air pollution index using existing portable AQI sensors. We will test to what extent Geneva’s air pollution is geospacial related, and if people are interested in having a personal device that makes the air pollution level around them visible.
