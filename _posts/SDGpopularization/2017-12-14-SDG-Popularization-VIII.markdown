How to film a “What can you do about the SDGs” Video

Raising awareness about the Sustainable Development Goals was the primary aim of our initial work when creating the ‘SDG Popularization’ Video. However for the second part of our project, we concentrated on explaining what the SDGs were and how every individual can work towards the SDGs in their everyday lives. 

We came up with a series of questions that we would ask individuals who are working towards the SDGs. The videos would aim to educate the public unaware of the SDGs and to get the audience interested in them (as mentioned in Blogpost VI).
The questions would be precise, direct and quick. The questions would be asked while the interviewee is moving therefore its a talk through conversation while they are walking. The videos would be filmed at the workplace of the interviewee - related to their current projects regarding the SDGs. In order to keep the flow, the videos will be shot in one go without any pauses or edits to keep the video dynamic.

Questions:

We have added the list of questions (in English) below that structure the interview. A few questions have been customized according to the area of the expertise of the interviewee regarding the project they are currently working on.

One of the interviews has been conducted in Chinese and we have attached it below:

In the following paragraphs we will give detailed information on what equipment and techniques we used for filming the video and recording the audio:

Camera:

<br>

The Camera we have used is a Canon EOS 600D. This model is quite professional while still being affordable, this type of reflex cameras can also easily be found as second-hand product online at a lower price and still of good quality. We found out that no stabilisator is required, the quality of the video is already pretty good at focusing. Although, it would have been helpful if we had a handheld tripod or maybe a trolley to help us manoeuvre around the camera.

Audio:

For the audio recording, we used a microphone that can be easily clipped to a t-shirt or jacket and plugged into the phone. The iphone voice recording app was used to record the audio. Both the interviewee and the interviewer need a microphone and need to do the recording at the same time. Here is a picture of the microphones we used. Price per piece approx. 60 CHF.

In the end when putting the audio files together in Imovie, we muted the audio of the original video. The 2 audio files (the interviewee and the interviewer) had to be adjusted ant synced with the video. Each time the interviewee was speaking, we cut this part out on the audio file of the interviewer and vice versa, to avoid noise and echo sound. The image below will illustrate it: The green bars are the audio files, the purple bars are the subtitles.

Additional Advice:

It is important to let the interviewee know about the questions in advance, so he/she can prepare and think of some answers. That can help make the video flow better and saves the interviewee time. Obviously the interviewer also must be very prepared and know the questions, it’s good to have a sheet of the questions printed out at hand.

A brief discussion with the interviewee about the route that will be taken during the shooting of the video is also important. As the person asking the interview questions and the person filming the interview is not the same, it is important to tell the interviewee to not look at the interviewer, but at the camera instead.

When being well prepared and efficient, all the filming can be done in one or two shots and does not take longer than 15 min. In terms of editing, we had titles for location and the name of the interviewee. We also added subtitles for all the videos as some of them were not in english.
