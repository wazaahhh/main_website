Blogpost 2: Progress of ‘SDG Popularization’

Concept and Structure of the Video

Figure 1.

In terms of the concept of the video, we wanted to show a comparison of the negative impacts have on the world with the possible solutions to these issues.

The Catch:

We named the short video ‘Are you okay?’ as we felt that we live our daily lives normally without realizing the extent of impact we have on the earth. Therefore, starting of with a rhetorical question could create curiosity in the audience to finding out what’s wrong and what the video is going to be about. As we want to have a global approach towards this project, we didn’t want to limit the language to English. Therefore, the beginning of the video shows people saying ‘are you okay?’ in 7 languages - English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese and Urdu shown in Figure 1. We didn’t want the video to be educational rather a short informational video which is why there is no text throughout the video.

We decided to use a gopro for the filming. We downloaded the gopro app on our iphone so we could have a visual of what was being recorded. We managed to make the gopro work and record sample footage. However, we didn’t like the wide angle and the audio wasn’t very clear. Therefore, we decided to switch to our smartphone. We filmed the mini video clips from our phone and managed to import them into our computer.

After the mini video clips in multiple languages, we decided to collate negative imagery of human impacts on Earth.


The Shock: Problems

In this part we want to show what is going wrong in our world today, to create a feeling of anxiety in the viewer. On the one hand to catch the viewer’s attention, on the other hand to help remember the video on a deeper level. Because only when it is touching on emotions rather than logic, the video has a lasting effect. To emphasize the feeling of anxiety, we chose a quite dramatic music with a ticking sound as base rhythm, indicating that the time is running out soon. The music with the title ‘No Time for Caution’ originally comes from the movie Interstellar, a film where the main character is searching for an alternative planet, because the earth is doomed for destruction.

To prevent creating a random compilation of dramatic clip content, we tried to tackle each of the SDG through visual imagery. We have made a list where we assigned an equal amount of video sequences to every of the 17 SDGs, respectively to the problems the respective SDG is tackling. The negative impacts show over consumption, hunger, poverty, land degradation, deforestation, land pollution, water pollution. In one place where you can see people running into a black friday sale in america is followed by a malnourished child in Africa. In some parts of the world there is peace and harmony while other parts are engulfed in wars. For some SDGs the selection of video content was easier than for others, for example: for life below water, we can show a sequence of a turtle caught in a plastic bag. If we show this clip right after an image of a plastic dumping site, we can create causality between two SDGs, in this example, Sustainable Cities and Life Below Water. However, it is difficult to visualize more abstract concepts such as ‘Gender Equality’ or ‘Reduced Inequalities’. We tried to juxtapose imagery of over consumption with poverty. We pointed this out through images of a starving child right after the clip of meat production and over consumption. These imagery ends with the image of the Earth.

The Solution:

The SDGs will be presented with dramatic positive music to showcase their importance. The SDG logo along with each of the 17 goals will be shown. This will be followed by positive imagery of the Earth and the possible impacts we can make through the SDGs. Imagery of innovation, technological advancement and aforestation for instance have been shown. The positive visuals highlight that there is still hope and that everyone can get involved to reduce global disparities and reduce land degradation. The video will end with the phrase ‘Get involved’ to motivate the public to get involved in the SDGs and to initiate a change.

Hope:

The problem part is a lot heavier than the solution or hope part, not only in terms of emotional content, but also in length. This is intentional. Even if we want to give hope to people to make change, we nevertheless want to emphasize that these problems still exist. We want to avoid the viewer thinking that good things are already being done by others, so I don’t have to. We want the viewer to want to know more about the SDGs.
