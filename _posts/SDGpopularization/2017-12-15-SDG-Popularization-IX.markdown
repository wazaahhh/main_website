Blogpost 9: What can you do about the SDGs?

Legacy of our project:

The original aim of this project has been to create awareness about the human impacts on earth and the availability of the SDGs as a solution to these issues. In order to achieve our aim, we created a tool to create awareness about the SDGs via a short videos series. We wanted these videos to reach as many people as possible with our target audience being people who are unaware of the SDGs. 

However, we realised that we cannot reach our aims unless the audience themselves isn’t involved. It is imperative for people to contribute towards creating awareness about the SDGs and it solely can’t be us. The point is that we need to inspire individuals to create their own videos and inspire more people to create awareness about the SDGs and this links well with SDG 17 that partnerships and involvement of all actors would be extremely beneficial. In order for this to be achieved, we have created a manual to explain how we made our video with instructions in Blogpost 8. It can be accessed from the following link:

Another future aspect of our project can be to get more people involved such as celebrities. If we manage to get a famous person or a celebrity to create a short video to promote the SDGs, that's a great start. However, in order for this to gain more public attention, we had the idea of having individuals nominate more people. Similar to the ice bucket challenge where people did a challenge and ended it by nominated their friends and family. We can get people to create short videos about how they are contributing to the SDGs and at the end they can nominate people and the chain continues.
