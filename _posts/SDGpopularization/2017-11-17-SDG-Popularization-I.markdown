Blogpost 1: Progress of ‘SDG Popularization’

How to make the SDGs famous?

In the course of this Master and being surrounded by an academic environment here in Geneva, we are very aware of the existence of the SDGs as a solution strategy to tackle global socio-economic, environmental and political issues. As an individual, before being able to act towards the 2030 agenda, the first step is to know that such an agenda has been put into place. We found out that most of our friends, family or acquaintances have never heard of the SDGs, that’s why the aim of our project is the popularization of the SDGs and to measure to what extent we succeeded in raising awareness about the existence of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Before choosing the ideal tool to popularize the SDGs, we defined who our target group is, because this can influence a lot the choice and mode of media. We realized that our target group is very heterogenous:

- People who have not heard about the SDGs before
- People from all backgrounds, cultures and languages
- People of all ages and genders, but especially the younger generations

To fulfill these criteria, the most suitable tool to achieve the aim of popularizing the SDGs, according to our reflections, is the video. A visual message is universal and can be understood by everyone, and with a concentrated sequence of images (a video), a lot of content can be transmitted. A plus is also that a video has an oral component as well: With the suitable music, the emotional effect of the images shown in the clip can be intensified.  

What makes our video different from already existing similar videos? It is true that there are many videos showing the destruction of the environment, war, hunger or other disparities in our world, to create emotions of anxiety and concern. Although, these kind of videos often do not provide any solution on how to tackle these problems, which leaves the viewer with a bad feeling or feeling of guilt after watching, which may be counterproductive from a psychological point of view. On the other hand, our video does not aim to shock and criticize only, but mainly to present the SDGs as a solution. Of course, videos made by the UN explaining about the SDGs already exist, but these videos are using a too official tone and educational manner, which makes people, especially young people, feel bored about watching the video after the first few seconds.
For us, the final video should be aimed at people from everywhere in the world, because the problems the SDGs are set to tackle global problems. We want to avoid creating a Western-centered video, only addressing issues such as overconsumption for example, but to give all the problems, and thus the 17 SDGs, the same weight. Psychology-wise, we want to first capture the viewer’s attention, secondly, point out today’s socio-economic, environmental and political issues in a strongly emotionally devastating manner, and then present the SDGs as a possible solution strategy to tackle these problems and give a bit of hope by showing what can be done for improvement. In the next blogpost we will be talking more about this specific issue.

But how to measure the success in achieving our aims to Popularize the SDGs with our video? The ideal way to see whether the video managed to do this, is by having people watch the video first and then fill out a brief survey of 10 Questions. To ask the viewer what the purpose of the video was, what message the viewer got from watching it, and what could be made to improve the video. This survey is of course only a pre-survey. The final survey must be conducted on a larger scale and in several languages which would be a next step, as well as the analysis of and research for the most suitable sharing platforms for every region. For example, youtube, vimeo, facebook for Europe and North America, Youku, Wechat or Weibo for China.
