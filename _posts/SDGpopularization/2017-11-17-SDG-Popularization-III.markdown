Video in the making

Process:

The aim was to gather videos relevant for each of the SDGs and put together a short video. We found videos from youtube, documentaries and programs. We used an online video converter to download the files and convert them into MP4 format in order for them to be imported into iMovie. We used iMovie to put together short video and edited the music using Garage band.

We narrowed down each of the downloaded video to 3-5 seconds using iMovie. We learnt how to use iMovie for instance:

- how to import videos
- crop them
- move them from one place to another
- use transitions from one video to the next
- add music
- slow motion or fast forward

Figure 1 below shows a screenshot of the iMovie application that we used to piece together a short video.

Figure 2 below shows a screenshot of the Garage Band application we used to to merge 2 songs together. The final version was exported into MP3 and then imported into iMovie.

Progress:

Video made and exported using iMovie

1. The video was finally pieced together in the sequences explained in our first blog post. We showed the current global issues caused by humans followed by the SDGs shown as a solution for these issues. We aimed to present positive impacts human can have and that the audience should get involved. The video was uploaded on google drive and it can be viewed by anyone who has the following link:

Here is a link of our video on youtube:

2. A survey was made using the Google forms  in order to gather data.

The aim of the survey is to measure the effectiveness of the video. We want to measure whether the video was able to create awareness about global issues and the SDGs as solutions to these problems. In terms of the questions, we asked the age and gender of the participants in order to find out who our target audience is. The main questions asked if the participants were aware of the SDGs before watching the video and whether the video was effective in informing them about the existence and the applicability of the SDGs

The survey can be accessed from the following link:

Issues:

- Neither of us had used iMovie before therefore, it has been a task for us to learn how to use the application.
- We found it difficult to edit the music as the audio files were much longer than video file. We also had to merge 2 songs together therefore the transition from one to the next one had to be smooth and unnoticeable. Also, we found it difficult to adjust the music according to the images.
- We made a survey using ‘google drive’’ and sent out the link varying participants however there was a glitch and we weren’t able to access the data. Therefore, we changed our method and made a new survey using google forms.
