Blogpost 7: The Videos

What can you do about the SDGs?

We contacted interviewees personally to tell them about our project and upon their approval, we sent them interview questions and dedicated a time and place for filming. 

Miya Yang, student at University of Geneva

Our first participant was Miya Yang who is a fellow student on our Masters course. She is currently working on a project about air pollution in Geneva. As she has lived in Beijing, she has experienced extreme air pollution however, her project is highlighting the pollution in Geneva which isn’t considered a problem in the public eye. It would also be interesting for the Chinese public to become aware of the existence of pollution in Europe. 

We thought it would be interesting to invite her for our video series as her project is directly linked with the SDGs related to the environment and land degradation. Also it would be inspiring to see students genuinely involved in improving the local environment. We filmed her outside Uni-mail, Unige, Geneva. 

As youtube is banned in China and we want out videos to be accessible for the Chinese viewers, we uploaded Miya’s video to Youku which is a chinese video sharing website.

2. Marlyne Sahakian

Marlyne is an assistant professor at the University of Geneva and is currently teaching the ‘Social consumption and Social innovation’ class. Her current projects are about energy consumption patterns in Swiss romande and the Philippines. In Switzerland, energy usage isn’t much of a debate in the public eye.

Therefore, in terms of our video we thought it would be interesting for Marlyne to talk about her current projects related to energy resources and household energy patterns. Maybe this would encourage viewers to re-evaluate their energy usage. We filmed her at the Sociology department at Uni-mail, Unige, Geneva.

3. Sarah Zaidi

Sarah is a coordination support officer at UNEP. She is working towards creating a green economy through the transformation of the global financial system. She deals with the logistics of organizing meetings with government agencies, market sector institutions, experts, other international institutions, foundations, NGOs and also prepares documentation related to our work.

Therefore, in terms of our video we thought it would be interesting to work with someone who is actually working towards the green economy and financing projects related to the SDGs. The video was filmed at the International environment house II.

With a physics background, he is currently managing the development of technologies for crowdsourced research and promoting hands-on events at the Citizen cyberlab. His work with the Geneva-Tsingua initiative promotes partnerships and the awareness of the sustainable development goals.Therefore for our video, we thought it would be interesting to have Francois discuss his recent projects that are closely linked with all the SDGs. We filmed his video at Cern.

5. Kali Taylor

Kali Taylor is a project officer working for an NGO partnered with the ‘International institute for Sustainable Development’ (IISD) at United Nations. Her current initiatives promote collaboration with different actors on the implementation of the SDGs. Kali presents the viewpoints of NGOs while providing expertise on systems change and innovation.

Therefore, for our video we thought it would be interesting to have Kali talk about her perspectives about the SDGs from the point of view as an NGO representative and how Geneva on a local level is involved.
