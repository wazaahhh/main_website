As our lecturer Gregory Giuliani put it “the earth is complex a system of systems”. These systems intertwine, making it a never ending process to collect data and draw dots between these phenomenons. Currently, we, as humans, collect more data than we can technically store. That’s a LOT of data to process… How do we use this data, so as to make it useful for, interpretable by, and accessible to as many stakeholders as possible?

Spatial Data Infrastructures (aka SDI) is an umbrella term that refers to all policies, technology standards, databases, procedures for organisations and technologies to foster collaboration, use and management of geospatial data. This can seem quite arid, but an easier way to understand it would be “all that is needed to collect, use, share and interpret geospatial data”.
SDIs are very powerful tools, but they come with big challenges that make them hard to implement.

It is interesting to highlight the case of MAP-X, developed by UN Environment in collaboration with the World Bank. MAP-X is a cloud-based solution, allowing monitoring of the use of natural resources, contrasting sustainable versus unsustainable methods on maps. Four aspects must be addressed to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources: geospatial questions, socio economic context, interconnectedness of scales, unequal distribution of power between stakeholders.

So what are the 7 challenges of setting up SDI, such as MAP-X?
Difference in stakeholders and stakeholder interests
Decision-making should shift towards a more inclusive process, balancing out the interests of governments, the private sector and citizens in a fair way.
Data ownership rights
Managing commitment from governments is difficult, and the EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) was developed to address this issue, displaying the progress and collaboration of each country on a map.
Cultural differences in the work ethics
Commitment to SDI by the different countries varies widely depending on that country’s agenda, and the priority of SDI relative to other activities. Moreover, cultural differences make true commitment difficult to assess for MAP-X.
Fear of control loss over the data
The kind of data collected can be very sensitive and strategic. Stakeholders can fear that too much sharing will translate into a loss of power and revenues.
Data quality and legitimacy control
As the data collection is strategic, it is important that some checks and balances be set in place to ensure the neutrality of what is recorded.
SDI readiness, and user-friendliness
Infrastructure is of course key when speaking of SDI. In many countries, reliable and strong internet connection still are a challenge, as well as finding the right technical competencies to run SDI projects. SDI initiatives need to focus on capability building!
Difficulty of scaling up
	(On an internal level, for MAP-X).

Setting up a working SDI requires being able to navigate across a complex mix of diverging interests and different organisational cultures and is thus as much relational as it is technical.

Why go through all of this trouble, you may ask. SDI are crucial to tackle a lot of different problems, and most environment-monitoring activities require SDIs.

Our thoughts

As students invested in the SDGs, we find it very interesting to know about those tools and how they can be used. More importantly, knowing how complex it is to implement them gives us insight on the limitations of the data the SDIs are able to provide. This allows us to be critical while using those platforms and use them wisely.

Now you may consider yourself an expert in SDI, congratulations!
