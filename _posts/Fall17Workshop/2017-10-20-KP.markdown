<h1>Finding a place to live in Geneva.</h1>

*After reading all stories of struggle about housing in Geneva, I thought it was nice to give some advices for the future student generations.*

<h2>First Advise:</h2>

Start to look for a place to stay in May! Indeed, the more you wait, the less chances you will have to find a good place to live.

<h2>Second advice:</h2>
Make a plan. Putting your ideas together on paper and classify them, will calm you and give you more ideas. For my part, I took all the possible student houses information and made an Excel sheet with their names, numbers, hours to call and their answers.

<h2>Third advice:</h2>
Call all the people on your paper. You need to know where there is a free place. Then, go to visit the ones you are the most interested in.

<h2>Fourth advice:</h2>
If all student homes say that they are full and have no space for you, don't give up! You still can say that you want to be on a waiting list and you are willing to wait. After they see that you are very motivated, they may take you.

Good Luck !
