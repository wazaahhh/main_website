Today, we were introduced to the topic of Life Cycle Assessment by Damien Friot, the director of “*ea – Shaping Environmental Action*”, a consultancy specialised in environmental management & corporate sustainability.

LCA, or Life-Cycle Assessment, is a method of environmental impact comparison between different ways to answer the same need, or in other terms provide the same service. The objective is to reduce environmental impact along the product life-cycle, by taking preventive actions during the design at all stages.
All economic activities required to provide this function are considered, including production, distribution, marketing, maintenance, end of life, etc.
These activities are modeled and inventoried, analyzing their impacts using assumptions, and collected information and life-cycle inventory databases (e.g. ecoinvent, http://www.ecoinvent.org/).

A practical example is the study *ea* did for an airline company to determine if switching from metal to plastic cutlery would be beneficial in term of environmental impact. What is surprising in this example is that the weight reduction, when switching to plastic, would reduce fuel consumption – and emissions – strongly enough to reduce the life-cycle impact of the cutlery by 30%. This contrasts with our primary assumption that metal would be a more sustainable material than single-use plastic. This demonstrates the interest of this method for eco-design.

As a consequence, Life-Cycle Assessment can be used by companies to reduce their environmental impact – a form of risk management, or cut costs as in the airline example. But it can also be used in policy making, to study impacts induced by a population, specific activities, or products, and to use the results to chose where to focus policies.

This lecture was very interesting in that Damien Friot transported us in a completely different mindset, in the sense that he made us look at products’ environmental aspects from a different perspective, one maybe more pragmatic.

As an example, to the question about which step of a soda bottle’s life had the most important environmental impact, we answered it would be transportation or plastic waste. To what we discovered that the consumer, opting to keep the bottles in the fridge, is responsible of about half the carbon emissions related to this life-cycle.

Also, the fact that vegetables might have a lower environmental impact if packaged than if not, as it extend shelf-life, can be somehow counter-intuitive.

As a follow up to the previous post, on Life-Cycle Assessment, we thought it’d be interesting to share the  exercise Damien Friot gave us, as a hands-on example.
It starts with a practical case: a Swiss beer company wants to sell a low-environmental impact product, and needs help to select the bottle. Glass, or PET.
Provided informations were:
	Bottling process: punping, purifying, and filling: 0.02kWh
	End-of-life: waste is incinerated
	Total transportation (inputs, delivery, end-of-life): 200km

	Glass bottle weight: 200g Aluminum cap: 5g
	Plastic bottle: 20g		  Plastic cap: 3g

And an extract of an impact inventory database:

It turned out that the most important share of the glass bottle impact came from the glass bottle (63%) and aluminum cap (20%) production, as well as from transport (13%), whereas plastic bottle impact was spread between PET production and disposal. Nevertheless, we calculated the impact of the glass bottle to be about two time that of the plastic one.

Life-Cycle Assessment is recognized as key to sustainability, and to the achievement of the SDGs, yet it is a non-trivial method and, and  requires practice and discernment.

By the way, did you know that 25% of pharmaceutical industry emissions come from transport, of representatives, to hospital or doctors offices?
