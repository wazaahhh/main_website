Yesterday I attended the SDG Lab 2030 Geneva ecosystem update. The meeting was hosted by the Graduate Institute.

Here are a few takeaways:
- The “Geneva ecosystem” counts now over 100 member organizations (mainly IO; NGOs; private sector; academia). Attendants were mostly reporters from UN agencies, NGOs, some academia and companies.
- The SDG Lab is now trying to focus its work on the different opportunities offered by the 2030 agenda. The main challenge is to make sure that focusing the work does not mean fragmenting the work.
- In this view, SDG Lab has mandated Reos Partners (specialists in multistakeholders processes) to help them define and develop focus areas for the SDG lab. They conducted a [survey](https://reospartners.wufoo.com/forms/m171b91g1ac5q1g/) with members of the ecosystem that is open until mid-December. Their preliminary results show that Geneva is perceived as more operational and agile than New York and SDG Lab is willing to take this opportunity to become one of the main centre for the implementation of SDGs.
- Next events:
  - The [“So What”](https://www.sdglab.ch/ask-questions/so-what) series, which explore the intersectionalities of the different goals have had two iterations so far: the first one was hosted by WIPO and looked at the links between the issues of gender and innovation, the second one was hosted by IHEID and featured healthy lives (goal 3) with peaceful and inclusive societies (goal 16). No date has been set for the next one, but it will likely take place early 2018 and look at linkages between economic growth and the rule of law.
  - Starting January 2018, the SDG Lab is launching its [“randomized lunch trials”](http://geneva2030.org/lunch-trials). The idea is to register by submitting a bio and interests, then once a month, be connected with someone in the ecosystem whose interest or profile matches ours and go to lunch with them.
  - UNECE organizes its regional forum on sustainable development on 1 and 2 March 2018 in ICCG. This meeting is multi stakeholders (States + civil society) and follows up on the implementation of the SDGs. More details will follow through the SDG Lab.
- News tools: a new knowledge hub on SDGs hosted by the think-thank International Institute for Sustainable Development: sdg.iisd.org. The Graduate Institute also launched their own portal: http://sdg.graduateinstitute.ch which can be consulted by everyone but only researchers and professors of IHEID can contribute.

Kali Taylor from SDG lab will circulate notes from this meeting at a later stage, ask me for updates!
