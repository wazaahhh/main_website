In the city of Kimshasa, less than 20% of SW are collected and deposited in controlled landfills. This is a mayor issue as 80% of the SW is left on uncontrolled landfills around the 9965 km2, where 12 million people live.  This may cause serious environmental and health impacts in this very dense populated area.

Up to now there was no way to really monitor and control the deposit of the waste in landfills.  The lack of data on SW landfills localization in the city makes it very difficult for the authorities to develop efficient waste management strategies. 

About the project:

Through the joint initiative of the University of Kinshasa [DRC], Université Pédagogique Nationale [DRC], University of Geneva [CH], this project was designed to test an approach to gather the missing data by involving the community and citizens and an accessible technology to the locals (mobile phones and internet).  The use of crowdsourcing and citizen science as a possible mechanism to involve different group of stakeholders in identifying, localizing, describing landfills, creating a spatial and temporal database was tested.

A crowdsourcing platform was created that allowed local observers to submit information/reports, while creating a spatio-temporal archive of observations. Essential data on SW disposals was collected through multiple sources (SMS, emails, Twitter, custom surveys) and multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web), then validated, analyzed and downloaded in various formats. The reports, pictures, videos generated by participants were uploaded in the dedicated web application for easy access from government authorities and other stakeholders.

Capacity building (e.g. webinars & tutorials) was a necessary first step to develop users’ skills to apply the tools and report an observation. The target group was 30 students from the two universities in Kinshasa who, then, trained other citizens. Campaigns were organized by the students to gather observations and report them accordingly in the platform using the web form. 

In order to ensure that the data collected is of sufficient quality, it should follow a data validation process that verifies firstly the completeness, accuracy and consistency of data and, secondly, it is reviewed by a second person (usually an expert) for approval.

As a result of this crowdsourcing initiative, the platform is now operational and includes the most detailed database on landfills in Kinshasa. It is expected that the information available will support local authorities in developing efficient waste management strategies. 

About crowdsourcing

In recent years, crowdsourcing has been coined as a promising alternative to gather data. It is a technique to outsource the work and divide it between participants to achieve a cumulative result, tapping collective wisdom of a crowd to find a solution to a problem that affects it. 

The concept of ‘Citizen Science’ is when crowdsourcing is used to involve members of the public in collaborative scientific research projects to address real-world problems. It contains four levels, starting from crowdsourcing which is to use citizens as sensors. The level 2 to 4 are distributed intelligence, participatory science, and extreme, respectively.

There are a number of crowdsourcing platform available online. The one this project used was the Ushahidi platform, with open source tools that enable local observers to submit information/reports using their mobile phone or internet, while at the same time creating a spatio-temporal archive of observations.

Some other crowdsourcing platforms are also well accepted with various features. The best crowdsourcing sites according to TopTenReviews are listed below. Check them out and you may find any of them can be used in your project.
