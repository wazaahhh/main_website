Hello everyone! We are checking in to update you on the midterm presentation of our project that took place on the morning of November 17th in the SDG Solution Space. We first talked about the global impact of our problem, then the objectives of our project, the midterm rescope, and lastly summarized the progress we made so far.

1. Global Impact

Plastics production has increased from 15 million tons in 1964 to 311 million tons (2014), and is expected to double until 2034. And as shown in figure 1 and 2, plastic packaging is the largest application, currently representing 45% of the total volume of plastics used. Globally, 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling and 14% goes to incineration and/or energy recovery process. 72% of plastic packaging is not recovered at all: 40% is landfilled, and 32% leaks out of the collection system (not collected at all, or illegally dumped).

China is responsible for about 28% of the plastic being swept into oceans. Currently, the overall recovery rate of online-ordering food containers is very low. Food delivery services have proliferated since last year, which creates large amounts of waste due to the plastic containers, bags and utensils used. The biggest food delivery app in China have between 14 to 18 million monthly users. Each company foresees 4 to 5 million orders/day.

2. The objectives of the project are twofold:

1) identify the best alternative for plastic food container (e.g. plastic, degradable plastic, biodegradable, wood and glass) by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to assess the environmental impact of plastic food containers and other food containers made of alternative materials; and

2) track and measure plastic pollution from food ordering service by using GPS tracking system to map the footprint of plastic food container disposal. Appropriate asset tracker need to be identified, one example as seen figure 3.

3. Mid-term re-scope of the project

Ideally, to conduct a comprehensive research project, this study would cover three phases: collecting macro facts that illustrates the plastic pollution problem from the food ordering services; drafting informed proposal of the “greenest” option; developing communication and collaboration plan with different actors. Nonetheless, due to the limited time and resources, the focus of this semester has shifted to the second phase, analyzing different materials of food container to propose informed decision.

According to ISO 14040 series, LCA is the only internationally accepted method for substantiating a claim or decision that one product, service or technology is environmentally preferable to another. Thus the revised project scope is focusing on using LCA approach to evaluate the life cycle environmental performance of two materials (plastic and paper) in order to inform policy-makers, producers and consumers about the “greenest” option.

Beyond the end of this semester, it is highly possible to carry on the project into the rest two phases. For instance, design a business plan for the best option, provide advisory services to government policy-makers, and promote education campaigns in collaboration with NGOs and/or other institutions interested to raise consumers awareness.

4. Progress made so far

The LCA methodology is about evaluating the economic, environmental, and social impacts of a product from “cradle-to-grave”. The LCA comprises 4 phases: (i) the goal and scope definition, (ii) the inventory analysis, (iii) the impact assessment, and (iv) the interpretation.  Up to now, the first phase was conducted and the inventory analysis is underway. It requires examining the sequence of steps in the life cycle of the product system, beginning with raw material extraction and continuing on through material production, product fabrication, use, and reuse or recycling, and final disposal. For each step, the inventory identifies and quantifies the material inputs, energy consumption, and environmental emissions (atmospheric emissions, waterborne wastes, and solid wastes).

In regards of GPS tracking system, we have contacted with experts from MIT lab and other departments for professional advice on technology feasibility. Lastly, we learned there was a similar project named “Smart Trash” from the Geneva-Tsinghua summer program, and reached to the students for more details if can be of any help of our project.
