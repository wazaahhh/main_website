Hi Everyone,

A quick update about our project regarding LCA application. 

On this past Monday, we met again with the LCA expert Damien Friot, Director from EA, a startup based in Geneva providing services including outsourcing & consulting, gamification, eco-design, sustainable business model & foresight. He came to give us a lecture of “Introduction to LCA” at the SDG space on Oct 6, which inspired our group to use LCA approach for our project. 

We sent him our project objective, methodology, expected output and draft report prior to the meeting, for him to better prepared. Then over the one hour in-person meeting, we showed him the three LCA reports we created using an online software name LCA Calculator, for plastic container, recycled paper container, and glass container, respectively. We concerned it is too simple as it only gave data on CO2 emissions. Therefore, Damien offered to help us pull out relevant data from Ecoinvent, which including unlinked unit processes as well as life cycle inventory results and impact assessment results. We weren’t able to do that as we only have free guest account no license, thus limited access to the database and couldn’t download data. 

Another good news to hear from him is that, he confirmed our project is heading to the right direction. Despite the LCA study might not be comprehensive enough to give advice to policymakers, we can still have some interviews with private sector such as local food-delivery companies in China to see if there’s any opportunities. Additionally, he mentioned there’s a group of students and professors at EPFL who are researching on plastic related topic that might be interested for us to reach out. So we are planning to follow up with them in the next couple days.

After the meeting, we have compiled an excel sheet of our assumptions and results from three different type of container materials, and shared with Damien to pull out data from Ecoinvent. Below is the quick summary, showing total CO2 equivalent of three types of container, considering product mass of 100*1000ml containers, average transport distance is 300 km from factory to restaurant.

This table shows for the same volume container, plastic one is more polluted than paper. Glass has way higher CO2 equivalent simple because it’s heavier. Since it is supposed to be reused several times, the total CO2 equivalent will be distributed by usage times to drop to similar level with the rest. This is to find out at least how many times we should reuse glass container if we want to minimize the environmental impact to make it a better alternative for plastic. 

Hopefully with more data from Ecoinvent next week, we’ll be able to deep dive the inventory results and conduct a comprehensive interpretation.
