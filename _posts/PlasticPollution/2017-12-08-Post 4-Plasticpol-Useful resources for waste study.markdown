Hi Everyone,

Remember we had a meeting with summer school student Carole a few days ago, and we just received her email recently, sharing some very useful resources that we think might be interested to you.

Most of the links below are introduced by Nicholas Johnson from the Center for Urban Science and Progress (NYU). nicholas.johnson@nyu.edu

1. Discarded Studies: https://discardstudies.com/

This is the most popular collection of waste research related to the social sciences. The website is designed as an online hub for scholars, activists, environmentalists, students, artists, planners, and others whose work touches on themes relevant to the study of waste and wasting.

Discard practices involve many elements, including: social customs, labor arrangements, resource stocks and flows, economic relationships, cultural norms, public health controversies, political histories, geographies and circulation, materiality.
 
There’s often blog posts on newly opened phd research position across the globe, and you can sign up to follow latest post via Email, or follow their FB page.

2. Basurama:http://basurama.org/en/ 

An excellent spanish based nonprofit developing interactive art projects to education about waste. Basurama is an artist collective dedicated to research, cultural and environmental creation and production whose practice revolves around the reflection of trash, waste and reuse in all its formats and possible meanings. It was born in the Madrid School of Architecture (ETSAM) in the year 2001 and, since then, it has evolved and acquired new shapes.

Read some of their projects, and you may get some inspiration for your projects regarding how to educate target audience in an artistic way. Especially recommended to the Future Cities specialization as many projects are about sustainable urban building and life. 

3. Curb Your Litter: http://curbyourlitter.org/

Similar to our project, Curb Your Litter is working to make the systems that handle our waste more clear, and to measure the problem with new methods for collecting data. The ultimate goal is that their findings will help stop litter at the source.

Curb Your Litter worked with the Center for Urban Pedagogy and a group of students at Frances Perkins Academy to dig deeper into the complicated world of garbage infrastructure. Over the course of the 2015 – 2016 school year, the students created Talking Trash: Throwing Out the Big Apple, a documentary that explains who decides where our trash goes and how communities can have a say in these decisions in the case of New York City. An interesting one to watch. 

Moreover, they realized there is not enough data to understand the extent of the problem, so they developed new ways to measure litter, working with ClosedLoops, an infrastructure planning and development firm dedicated to making cities more sustainable from the inside out.

They even created three ways for citizens to contribute to data collecting around neighborhood litter problems, including join a clean up day, add data to “MAP THE Trash!” (below is the interactive map screenshot), and take a survey. This crowdsourcing approach reminds us of what we learned from class, and another group’s Crowdsoil project. Maybe we can carry out similar one when we’re in Tsinghua over the third semester.

4. Open Trash Lab - http://www.opentrashlab.com/

Open Trash Lab is an organization dedicated to enabling and encouraging citizens to take an active role in understanding waste’s pervasiveness in our society. Open Trash Lab serves these interests and efforts by facilitating and furthering research projects, hosting regular workshops and events and fostering both public and private partnerships to provide a greater foundation of waste knowledge. Engaging the public to take an active role in understanding waste issues is key to improving our current waste system. Open Trash Lab aims to provide a platform for public discussion and participation in order to create a more informed society and better approaches towards waste management.

So far there are five projects listed on the website. One of them is eCan, very similar to the summer program student’s project “Smart Trash”. And the project is Kickstarter for crowdfunding.( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/emrals/ecan-machine-learning)

Another project is mapping the landfill locations in US using Landfill Hunting, which is a application for PyBossa that allows citizens to crowdsource landfill data using Microsoft Bing images. The full list as of today has 1235 landfills in total.  

Most surprisingly, one project name Life of Trash shared the similar methodology as our GPS tracking idea. Researcher firstly throwed a phone into trash bin and then track its real location over 6 hours, visualizing its path through the city as shown below. Moving forward, the plan is to create version two of the application and backend structure to allow the deployment of multiple phones simultaneously. Viewing the path of several pieces of trash should allow an even more profound understanding of where trash goes once its been collected.

Final comments: plastic waste is a serious problem getting a lot attraction all over the world. Many actors are working on tons of projects to tackle the problem. Whenever you have an idea, try to reach out to as much people as possible, to learn from other’s projects. It would’ve been very helpful for us if we learned above resources from the very beginning of our project, but now is not too late either. We’re glad we’re not alone in terms of fighting plastic waste:)
