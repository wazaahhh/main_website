Integration in Progress - Introduction 

Who are we?

We are a group of five motivated students currently doing a Master’s in Innovation, Human Development and Sustainability at the University of Geneva in partnership with Tsinghua University, China. This program is highly interdisciplinary which will focus on “defining and developing concrete institutional solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals”.

How did the group form?

All five of us presented individual pitches for a module about Measuring and Predicting Sustainable Development,  however all of us gravitated towards working together on a project about the refugees as the SDG’s lack on tackling the refugee crisis which has become a global issue. In order for you to get to know us here is a brief summary of our backgrounds:

What is our group project about?

After brainstorming and exchanging ideas, we have created the following research question to guide us: How can the role of intermediater’s help to integrate Refugee Women in the society in Geneva and reduce inequalities. Thus, we have named our project “Integration In Progress” as our aim is to explore the field by carrying out research in terms of finding literature and official reports published by reliable sources. Moreover, we have conducted interviews of associations, NGO’s and institutions working with refugees and we will carry out more research.

Future Plan:

We came up with the idea of organising a Hackathon where we could invite different institutions, associations and organisations who provide programmes and support to Refugee Women in Geneva. We can narrow down 2-3 themes which will focus on ideas and discussion around the challenges faced by Refugee Women. Our objective for this Hackathon will be to create a network to connect the existing institutions and associations along with the Refugee Women in order to exchange knowledge and ideas which will be beneficial for future partnerships. This will also be a great meeting point to understand the role of intermediators and the way in which their position is critical in helping Refugee Women integrating in the society.
