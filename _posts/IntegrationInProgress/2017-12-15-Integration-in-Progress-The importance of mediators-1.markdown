Integration in Progress - The importance of Mediators

Many of the organisations we met, encountered problems in getting past the cultural barriers experienced by the refugee women. Through the interviews we conducted, we observed that the programmes provided by the organisations face challenges in addressing the needs or interests of the refugees. Therefore, in some situations the organisations offer certain programmes and support however the refugee women have other needs which aren’t fulfilled. This leads to issues which can potentially hinder their integration in the host country.

Integration needs to be on two levels: 1) on the social and 2) on the work level. For the latter, to enter in the job market, integration is an essential step in order to be a “functioning” member of society and to be able to financially support oneself or family. Refugees go through a tough journey, and often their physical and mental health is compromised, which then affects their ability to adapt to the new environment. In worst case scenarios, individuals that are not well integrated in the socio-cultural society find themselves in a situation of exclusion, precarity and poverty. Its consequences not only concerns the migrants but the whole society as well.      

Among the many obstacles preventing migrants from accessing employment, we have to consider the persistent prejudices and stereotypes that can possibly portray some communities in a negative light which can be lead to problems and misunderstandings. A project from the Bureau d’integration des étrangers was launched in 2016 aimed at integrating refugees in the workforce of Geneva. One of the obstacles they found: fight the stereotype that migrants “are just not motivated, therefore unemployed”.
 
In order to facilitate the integration of refugee there is a need to bridge the gap between “local” actors and refugee communities. Through our research we have discovered the importance of cultural mediators who understand the help being provided by the actors and the way in which it can be used effectively for refugees. Not only communication is facilitated through the shared language, but also culture and shared experience and the ability to understand are tools that allow them to be better guides and support the needs of the specific refugee community.

For instance, not looking directly into someone’s eyes might be interpreted in a different manner in depending on various  cultures. It might be interpreted as rude or, on the contrary, a sign of respect. Cultural mediators might have the experience to decipher certain behaviours that are not expressed orally: fears, and insecurities, that can be understood through bodily behaviours.

Most importantly, mediators know what advises to propose in emergency situations, and they’ll be able to inform the refugees of their rights, and provide information on how to access facilities and other crucial public services like healthcare. Especially in this last field, cultural sensitivity is particularly important when it comes to women, since they are often targets of abuse and violence in migration contexts. Therefore we consider fundamental the presence of mediators, women, that can provide them a safe space for dialogue and support. 
  
One particular organisation in Geneva, Inter-Actions (an association that wants to promote intercultural communication, social cohesion and personal development) have found a way to bring the ethnic community closer to them. They have a position for people called “Ambassadors” who are charismatic individuals that come from the same cultural background as the migrants. Their objective is to propose activities that are more suited to the needs and desires of refugees and that will be effective in helping them integrate in the socio-cultural society. 
 
Many other organisations understood the importance of cultural mediators: first of all UNHCR, but also Médecins Sans Frontières and the International Organization for Migration. Overall there is an increasing demand from humanitarian organisations to work closely with these professionals. Many universities, particularly in Italy, offer master’s programs aimed to train mediators that can in the future work in organisations for refugees, reception centers and social services.
 
One of the objectives for our project is to find solutions to incorporate these important actors within the process of integration in the context of Geneva. By working closely with local actors (AMIC - Association des médiatrices culturelles, Maison Kultura and Collectif Interculturel de Médiation), we hope to partner them with the different associations that are involved with refugees. This would possibly be one of the challenges that participants will try to solve in the context of our Hackathon in March.
