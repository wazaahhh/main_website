Integration in Progress - XIVth UNOG – DCAF Seminar- Part 2

Leveraging SDG 16 to Improve Implementation of SDG 5. 


Topic 2 Patriarchal Masculinities - Mr Anthony Keedi

The speaker starts by explaining what he’s learnt in his life: to be strong, not vulnerable, to be a rock and figure of reference for the people you care about. Like a superhero. Through his talk he was challenging the notion of men and masculinity. He was questioning the definitions of what is mean to be a “man”, what “manhood” and “masculinity” stand for.

The concept of masculinity is strictly associated with violence and Anthony makes us reconsider the way we view violence. All throughout history, there were two predominant ways to respond to violence: 1) by fear and submission or by 2) fighting violence with violence. The second option uses money which is spent on funding the military; however we need to ask ourselves, is this the best way to implement “security”?. Therefore, the notion that “violence is necessary” in order to be safe is deeply problematic. 

In the context of conflicts, women are primarily the ones who are the targets of violence and the individuals who are more at risk. He gave an example of a focus group where the women argued that “as the state is violent against our men, it is okay for our men to be violent against us”. Thus, it suggests that even women in some situations are justifying violence, since even for them, violence is seen as the only viable solution. Therefore, it means  that implementing security through violence means more violence towards women. 

For Anthony, it is essential that we look through peace and security through a more feminist and gender equal lens, and that these gender issues should be on the agenda of every major meeting of great powers, whenever security and war are being discussed. These issues should not be considered as side topics and most of all should not just interest women: everyone should be responsible.  

What we’ve learned:

Currently, limited people and type of people are the ones making decisions about security and peace, but in order to leverage SDG 16 to improve implementation of SDG 5, it is crucial to consider things with a gender-sensitive perspective.

Topic 3 The Context of Vulnerability - Ms Kate Gilmore

Women are often referred as being part of the “vulnerable populations”. We’ve all heard and read  “women, children and other vulnerable populations” in articles, panels and events. This practice automatically assigns a certain label to a group of individuals on the basis of their gender. However, according to K. Gilmore the way in which our society addresses the concept of vulnerability is deceptive as it hides the particularities and individual abilities of women while regarding them as a homogenous group.

This derives from the persistence of the idea that your reproductive organs are determinants of your inherent value to your contribution to the world. Women shouldn’t be homogenized and recognized as just vulnerable individuals, they should be seen as individuals with capabilities to aim and achieve anything.  

Kate proceeds to question parliaments and their obsession with women’s bodies. She thinks that parliamentarians don’t need to debate about criminalising abortions or stripping women from sexual and reproductive health rights, and that women should be given the right to make decisions freely about their bodies. 

It is critical to understand the system of relationships whereby it’s not only about the construction of the body of women but also about the construction of the identity of the male. Masculinity, as defined by traditional society, is a tiny rigid little box which defines what it means to be a “man”. If you cry, you’re not a man, if you show emotions you’re not a man. If you take care of children, you’re not a man. If you’re anything out of the box of “masculinity” you’re not a man. 
The way the society sees and portrays men and women needs to be changed and every individual should be given the fundamental right and freedom to express emotions, have goals and be free to speak their mind regardless of their gender.

What we’ve learned:

Women on their own are a fully capable and autonomous resource. In order to understand that we need to get past the idea that they need protection and need to be rescued. As Kate says, women only need “the barriers that are in their way to be taken away and to be granted freedom, freedom in all areas, from the streets to the bedroom”. Denying women their rights and freedoms is essentially dehumanizing them: sure, it’s not too late to fix this, but boy! It’s overdue! 

This conversation about gender inequality is not over. It has to continue!
