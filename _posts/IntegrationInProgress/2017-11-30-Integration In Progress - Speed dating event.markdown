Speed dating event in Carouge 30.11.2017

Authors: Amaëlle Grosjean & Tina La


On the 30th of November in Carouge, the event called “speed dating for volunteering” took place, where 70 organizations were gathered 
in Geneva aiming at recruiting some new volunteers for their programmes. 

The organizations were split into the following five categories: sports, social, disability, international cooperation and migration.
Each of them had their own stand with flyers and employees who you could talk to. 

The rules for conducting the event effectively were as follows : the potential future volunteers had the opportunity to go to every stand
to listen to the organization's’ activities and ask questions with a rotation of every seven minutes. Therefore, everyone had the
opportunity to meet different organisations and know more about their programmes and ask questions.

On the one hand, participating in this event was a great occasion for having a glimpse of the actors concerned by migration issues
in Geneva. On the other hand, the idea of speed dating is an excellent way to have some interesting conversations. Since organising
the Hackathon is a part of our project, it is essential to broaden our network and to start making trustful contacts. 

After several enriching discussions in pace with the sound of the bell every seven minutes, we had the chance to interact with eight
associations among which four were interested to participate in our Hackathon. 

Taking part in this event was very beneficial for the group project as we have managed to expand our network and made contacts with 
four new associations. Additionally, we realised that our project idea created enthusiasm and interest amongst the organisations as well.
Indeed, they all agreed there is a need to improve communication between the actors involved in migration issues in Geneva and offering 
them a space to exchange their resources is a valuable idea. 

However, meeting people is not the hardest part and we have still a lot ahead of us to make this hackathon happen in the early part of 
2018. From now on, in order to reach our objectives, we will set the Hackathon’s organizational part as a priority for the following weeks.

We are looking forward to presenting details on how this hackathon will be running, when and with whom!
