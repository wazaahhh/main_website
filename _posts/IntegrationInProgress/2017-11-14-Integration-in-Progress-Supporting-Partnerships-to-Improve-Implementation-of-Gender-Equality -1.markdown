Integration in Progress - Leveraging SDG 16 to Improve Implementation of SDG 5. 

On Thursday the team went to a seminar named: Leveraging SDG 16 to Improve Implementation of SDG 5, organized by DCAF. We decided to attend this seminar since it focuses on topics that are extensively linked to our project. We believe that Goal 5 cannot be achieved if strong institutions aren’t in place to reinforce good practices in order to diminish the obstacles preventing Gender Inequality.  

“Since landmark Beijing declaration in 1995, we’re nowhere near where we should be”. Opening speech by Michael Moller (Director-General of UNOG), initiated the seminar by highlighting how stereotypes of the role of women and men is a huge obstacle in today's time that still makes our society not sustainable. He encouraged the audience to understand the magnitude that the  empowerment of women could have on the global market in terms of global health and society.

Moreover, he mentions that the measures that need to be implemented at the national level are the same for the international level as well. The UN itself is not immune to these global trends whereby only 3% of the peacemakers are women. In order to improve the current situation, he suggests a few recommendations for potential change makers to combat gender inequality. The one example that stood out for us was called the “panel pledge”, whereby whenever the panellist (male) is invited to speak at a panel where no women are panellists, he pledges to refuse to participate. 

He concludes saying that in order to achieve gender equality, it is necessary to first identify gender inequality, in order to fight and solve them.

On that day, three speakers were invited to offer to the audience their take regarding issues of gender inequality:

Judge Svjetlana Milišić Veličkovski, Implicit Gender Bias 
Anthony Keedi, Patriarchal Masculinities
Kate Gilmore, ''The Vulnerable'' vs. Vulnerable Situations

Topic 1 Implicit Gender Bias –  Ms Svjetlana Milišić Veličkovski 

While questioning the qualities we associate with judges, there are no doubts about fairness and impartiality. On the contrary, Sviatlana highlights the existence of implicit gender bias in all of us, even in judges. Researches demonstrate how we all hold unconscious stereotypes, and how we are all subject to implicit bias, which affects our decisions. Sviatlana made us think about how these unconscious stereotypes form the basis of our everyday decisions without even realising. What are the implications of these biases, in a court, if done by a judge, that has to issue a sentence? 

An example about domestic violence was mentioned and results showed how judges are often too lenient with the perpetrator in this form of violence, and issue sentences that are not at all proportionate to the seriousness of the offense. This bias is not only limited at court. 

It is understood that certain notions are deeply embedded in our societies, maybe more in some countries as compared to others. For example, there is always the assumption that only mothers have the ability to take care of children whereas fathers are considered to be incapable of nurturing and taking care of children. Or stereotypes regarding women in career advancements which is seen as too aggressive or too ambitious. These gender stereotypes about the role of women and men is potentially damaging and will have long-term impacts on the society as well. 

Sviatlana suggests some possible improvements but emphasizes that it is not possible to end this gender bias without changing our entire culture. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce the negative impacts by changing mindsets by allowing young girls and boys to explore different social characteristics, roles, behaviours and activities by themselves. 

She provides recommendations for judges as well, for example gender bias trainings where they could be trained to be more sceptical of their own perceived objectivity and challenge the idea of impartiality. « Believing that we’re objective, make us more suspiciously to bias », she says. They could be trained to be more aware of the possible bias and prepare them to re-think their points before taking decisions which could make them better judges. Sviatlana recognises that this is an action aimed at individuals but it could also be applied to the institutional level. 

She gave examples of gender bias-free solutions that already proved to be effective: e.g. blind auditions for selecting musicians for an orchestra, who’ll play behind a curtain, in order to avoid the gender factor to be a criteria of selection.

What we’ve learned:
Even judges, whose job is to be fair and just, can take certain decisions through the unconscious  gender bias that clouds their mindsets. This bias can result in consequences if the decision is taken by institutional actors such as the police, judges etc. 

This event was very interesting, thus, we have summarised what we’ve learnt in another blog. This is why you’ll find the second part of this blog post in our coming blog post #6 ! Stay tuned for topic 2 on Patriarchal Masculinities and 3 The Context of Vulnerability
