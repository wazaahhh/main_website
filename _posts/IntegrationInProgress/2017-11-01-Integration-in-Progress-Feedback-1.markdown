Integration in Progress - Feedback


The aim of our project is to organize a Hackathon in order to find solution to integrate women in the socio-cultural society in Geneva. We are targeting the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 10 (reduce inequalities), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and 17 (partnership). With our event, we wish that the organizations invited would connect to each other, exchange their ideas towards a common goal and hopefully come up with concrete solutions.

This project allowed us to explore the relevance of gender equality within the refugee integration process, while assessing the situation at a local level. Since women and men are facing different needs, they should be provided with distinct asylum procedures and politics to be the most accurate at every step of the refugee cycle. Check out our blog post about “Why focusing on women refugees” to know more about the subject.

Our objective was to collect qualitative data by conducting interviews in order to identify the current problems experienced by refugee women in Geneva in terms of integrating in the society.

While carrying out our research, we realised that women refugees indeed have difficulties in entering the labour market, however if they are not well integrated in the social society, their difficulties can be amplified. Thus, in order to facilitate their integration there is a need to bridge the gap between “local” actors and refugee communities. We thought it was important to let cultural intermediators facilitate connections, whereby they can offer support and guidance according to the needs of the specific refugee community. Check out our blog post about “The importance of cultural mediators” to know more about the subject.


Our project was well received by other students and researchers at the Solution Space and was provided with useful contacts and suggestions helpful for our project’s further development. Although the majority of the interventions were mainly questions about details on the organization of the event, a couple of comments are worth to highlight. One of those was the suggestion to expand our research question in other areas outside Geneva, including other cities within Switzerland or neighbouring countries who are facing similar challenges. In doing so, we’ll be able to widen our focus to examine and learn from the methods that revealed to be effective and useful.

Another really useful contribution from one of our classmate was about setting goals for what we expect as the outcome of the event. For example: finding ways to implement cultural mediators as good practice in every association could be one of the topics at the Hackathon.


Overall, throughout the discussions after our presentation, we understood the added value of our project which could be the improvement of communication between various organisations regarding different specific themes such as the cultural intermediators. This event is a unique opportunity to bring the important actors at the table towards a cooperative process that will generate creative initiatives.

Since the day of the feedback, we have a clearer insight of the impact of our project as well as a better understanding on how to proceed. Organizing an event is not an easy task: many aspects to take into consideration, and moreover, it takes time! This is why we plan on organizing this event in a couple of months, which will give us time to contact the potential organizations and think about the details and the technicalities of the event. We will be using this constructive feedback to guide us throughout our project.

We'll keep you posted on our progress!!
