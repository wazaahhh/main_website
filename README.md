# SDG Solution Space Website

## About
This repository contains the website, sitting at http://www.sdgsolutionspace.org, that serves as a window into the Master in Innovation, Human Development  and Sustainability of the University of Geneva, as well as a repository for anything that happen, or is created, at the SDG Solution Space.

## Contributing
You may be reading this document because you were asked to contribute to this website as a documentation for your project or event, or for any other reason, anyway, you're here to learn how to do what you want to do on this website.

Basically, this place is running on Jekyll, and the main thing you need to know is how to write a document using the markdown syntax, and then uploading this document to this repository.

### Writing posts
For the markdown part, there's a nice tutorial [here](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/). For those who maybe more familiar with the concept of markup languages, here's a quick [cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/), with the associated [markdown code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md).

Here's an [example](https://github.com/sdgsolutionspace/website/blob/master/_posts/Fall17Workshop/2017-12-20-SDG-Solution-Space.markdown) of a nicely written post about the SDG Solution Space.

Here's the actual [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdgsolutionspace/website/master/_posts/Fall17Workshop/2017-12-20-SDG-Solution-Space.markdown) behind it. 

Please note the header:
```jekyll

```
Note the date and title, that you should indeed update. About categories, that could be 'events' or 'fablab', for example.
Now, about the authors, please put your pseudonym if you are in the website's "people" page, or your actual name, in quotes, if you're not.

### Uploading posts

Now that your post is all written and ready to be uploaded, there are two ways you can take. If you're familiar with this website, or if you received specific consigns about what to do with your post, just do that. 

Else, provided you already have a github account set up and given upload rights, just go to the '\_posts/TODO' directory, and click 'Create new file' or 'Upload files', depending whether you want to write your document online, or drag-and-drop it from your computer.
