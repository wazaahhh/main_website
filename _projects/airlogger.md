Fine cartography of PM2.5/PM10 cartography for Geneva. AirLogger came from a simple concern: in Geneva, PM10 and PM2.5 measurements are hard to come by, and quite irrelevant. We want to provide a device to measure air quality, on the go, with the user, and aggregate them, so we can map the pollution, with the ability to advise the user on what to do to avoid pollution.
