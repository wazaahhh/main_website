The aim of this project is to tackle the current challenges related to the integration process of refugee women and refugees generally speaking, into the social and professional sphere. The method used in this project is so called "hackathon", which is an event that is expected to bring together actors with various experience and expertise coming from different backgrounds such as international organizations, private and public sectors, academia or civil society composed of refugees, specialists and students. We would like to bring a change in Geneva and improve refugees conditions with a focus on women.
