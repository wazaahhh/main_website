Geneva-Tsinghua Initiative provides INNOVATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMMES that address in a practical, hands-on way the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The different programmes last from two weeks to two years, during which the students spend part of their time in GENEVA, working directly with the International Organizations there, and part in BEIJING and SHENZHEN, in two of Chinaâ€™s most dynamic and entrepreneurial environments.
